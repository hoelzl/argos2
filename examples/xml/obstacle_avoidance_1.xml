                   For less than 100 robots thread management is not beneficial, so
                   here we set it to 0. When set to 0, it means that the computation is
                   not parallelized: the main thread does everything.

        Experiment configuration:
        - length: total experiment time in seconds (0 means the experiment has no time limit)

        - random_seed: seed of the main random number generator. If unset or set to
                       zero, this value is taken from the clock and a warning message
                       is displayed.

       You find it in the .cpp file of your controller.
       For this example, the macro is called in controllers/footbot_obstacle_avoidance.cpp:100.

         The <actuators> section contains a list of the actuators used by this controller.
         If you forget a to mention an actuator here and then request it in the controller,

         For a list of the possible actuators, type at the command prompt:
         $ launch_argos -q actuators

         Multiple implementations of an actuator are possible. To identify which one
         you want to use, pass it in the 'implementation' attribute below. When you
         type the 'argos -q' command, the implementation is in the square brackets
         following the name of the device:

         The <parameters> section is passed as-is to the controller's Init() function.
         The user, writing the controller, defines how it is organized.
